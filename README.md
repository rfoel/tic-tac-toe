# Tic-Tac-Toe AWS Serverless App

This awesome serverless application takes Tic-Tac-Toe to the next level by leveraging the power of websockets with AWS Lambda. Brace yourself for an exhilarating gaming experience! The frontend is a slick React app, smoothly deployed on S3 and Cloudfront.

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the brilliant mind of [Peter Sterckxs](https://gist.github.com/psterckx/b40040d5abe9e218ebd6849527389968). While building this, I decided to transition from CDK to Serverless Framework, and boy, it was worth the effort! The deploy pipeline is a masterpiece, handling the server deployment, custom domain setup, and finally, the frontend deployment.

## Design

The aesthetics of this project are heavily influenced by the exceptional work of [Oleg Frolov](https://dribbble.com/shots/5271196-Tic-Tac-Toe-app) on Dribbble. Although the original design was meant for a game that never saw the light of day, we resurrected its elegance to elevate the Tic-Tac-Toe gaming experience.
